Saluti da Val dei Pomi!

Continuing from the square of the Municipio, a sloping road curves up to the back of the village. The idea is to round off the composition of the village, and this sloping, curving road is inspired by the prototype. First a mockup to see how this would work:

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/driek/54417670495/in/dateposted/" title="Back street - 1"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54417670495_c2bab82fec.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Back street - 1"/></a>

A tight fit, but it seems to work. I could've made the street wider, but that would take up
space on the backside. This will do fine.

As in the prototype, most blinds are closed on the street side, giving it the feeling of a 'wall'.

A lesson learned from previous builds: always include openings for cables and light boxes even when not planning to include lighting (which the end I did anyway).

I split the five buildings in two blocks. The second block is a little less deep (or wide). This creates some leeway in positioning them to compose how the curve looks. The little opening on the back side looks a bit like an alley, and the blind walls have been painted a weathered grey._

Attaching the facades, backs first:

Hipped roofs are hard to get right, and light inevitably will escape I've learned. So I close the buildings off with a square roof first, and test them for light leaks.

As challange, the last two houses share a roof, on a curve. A curved, hipped roof! I'm proud that it worked in one go.

The roofs are on:

...and from the front, with chimneys and some weathering:
